# GBR Model Predictor üìä

This is a Streamlit web application that utilizes a pre-trained **Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR)** model to make predictions based on user-inputted features. Simply enter the required values, and the app will provide a predicted output along with a visualization of the input features.

## Features
‚úÖ User-friendly interface with dynamic input fields for each required feature.  
‚úÖ Scalable input data using **StandardScaler** for accurate predictions.  
‚úÖ Real-time predictions with an option to visualize input data using **bar charts**.  
‚úÖ **Error handling** for model loading and prediction processes.  

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
- joblib

## Installation
### 1. Clone the repository:
